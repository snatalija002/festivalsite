        <h1><em>King of New York</em></h1>
        <p><span style="color:red">Abel Ferrara's</span> "King of New York," a gritty action movie about a New York drug kingpin, was a surprise entry in this year's Telluride Film Festival, where tastes are usually loftier. Maybe the selection was intended to honor Ferrara as a stylist whose movies may look commercial but feel as if the soul of an artist is stirring somewhere inside them. That was the case with his episodes for TV's "Crime Story" and for his film "China Girl," the 1987 thriller that trapped two lovers, a Chinese-American girl and an Italian-American boy, in the battlefield between opposing gangs in New York's Little Italy and Chinatown. The movie was "Romeo and Juliet" recycled through "West Side Story" and the TV action series of your choice, but the look was something else - a garish, neon-lit film noir universe of warm lips, sleek hair and desperate eyes.
         </p>
<img  src="imgs/ny3.jpg" alt="King of New York" >
        <p>Now comes "King of New York," Ferrara's most expensive and ambitious picture to date, with borrowings from a different classic.

Instead of "Romeo and Juliet," this one recycles "Robin Hood," with <span style="color:red">Christopher Walken</span> as a New York drug kingpin who wants to use his profits to pay the budget of a hospital for poor people. The Walken character never quite gets around to explaining precisely how he plans to set up his financing, and I am not sure any money actually goes to the poor and sick, but it's a good idea, anyway.
